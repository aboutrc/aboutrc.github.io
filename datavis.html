<p> 3RD GRDE ELL MATH STUDENTS UNDERPERFORMING&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more students who do not speak English enter New York City classrooms, they can be assured of one thing: They will be taught to fail by design. The No Child Left Behind act of 2001 established a series of programs to help ELLâ€™s - students who demonstrated limited proficiency - with English proficiency as well as educational content to help them succeed. In states like New York, where the ELL population is estimated at 10 percent of the overall student population, these students are one and half times more likely to perform under grade level at New York State math examinations according to New York City Infohub data. &nbsp;</p>
